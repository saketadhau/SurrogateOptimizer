### Benchmark CSTR example

To generate the data using sensitivity based data augmentation technique and train the Neural network, run main_GenTrainData.m. It uses the following functions:
* BenchmarkCSTR.m
* buildNLP.m

main_CL_sim.m - runs the closed loop simulation either using the exact MPC or the approximate MPC. It uses the following functions
* BenchmarkCSTR.m
* buildNLP.m
* ApproxMPC.m
